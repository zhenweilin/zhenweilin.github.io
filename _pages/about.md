I am a final-year Ph.D. student at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) under the guidance of Qi Deng.  My research interest includes optimization theory, especially first-order method. Currently, I am a visiting student at Purdue University, working with Jimmy Zhang.



## Profile

I possess strong theoretical and practical skills. Throughout my doctoral studies, my research has been centered on the complexity analysis of first-order methods for various problems, including function-constrained optimization, minimax games, second-order cone programming (SOCP) and semidefinite programming (SDP). The core of my work involves strategies to accelerate convergence rates, supported by numerical experiments to validate theoretical findings. Additionally, a significant engineering achievement in my research is the application of first-order methods to solve SOCP and SDP.
